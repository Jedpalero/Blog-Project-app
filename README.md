#### Video Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ6nXFnXMfA>

#### Description:

It is a responsive blog app using JavaScript as the main language, and React for the framework. For the design I use bootstrap and sass, and fontawsoome for the icons. And for the app development backend I used Firebase, for the realtime database that store and sync data in real time across all of the users' devices.

In this blog I added several features like email authentication, search, like and comment. And I also make it responsive by making it possible for you to create a post, update and delete your blog. and lastly I included pagination in order for the user to view their post in discrete page.

It is also Responsive and you can view it from anywhere through phone or your personal computer.
